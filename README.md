### üßæ Data Loading in Power Query

![Data Loading](Dashbord_Project_Git/Assets/Loading_data.png)

**üîπ Data Loading & Transformation ‚Äì Power Query Editor**  
This screenshot shows the initial data import and transformation phase in Power BI using Power Query Editor. Datasets such as `fact_bookings.csv`, `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`, `dim_date.csv`, `dim_hotels.csv`, and `dim_rooms.csv` were loaded. Columns were renamed for clarity, data types corrected (e.g., date fields), and additional time-based columns such as Year, Month, and Weekday were created for better temporal analysis.

### üß© Data Model ‚Äì Star Schema

![Data Model](Dashbord_Project_Git/Assets/star_Schema.png)

**üîπ Star Schema Data Model**  
The data model follows a **star schema** design, optimized for reporting. At the center is the `fact_bookings`,`fact_aggregate_booking` tables, connected to dimension tables including `dim_date`, `dim_hotels`, and `dim_rooms`. The model supports:
This structure enables efficient querying and supports flexible, high-performance reporting.

![Total No Show Measure](Dashbord_Project_Git/Assets/total_No_Show_ms.png)

## üìä Power BI Measures and Calculations


Custom DAX expressions were created to enhance the analytical capability of the Power BI model. Below is a consolidated list of key DAX measures and calculated columns used:


-- üìÖ Time Intelligence
wn = WEEKNUM(dim_date[date]) 

day type =
Var wkd = WEEKDAY(dim_date[date],1) 
return
IF(
wkd>5,"Weekend","Weekday") 

-- üí∞ Revenue & Booking Performance
Revenue = SUM(fact_bookings[revenue_realized]) 

Total Bookings = COUNT(fact_bookings[booking_id]) 

Total Capacity = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity]) 

Total Succesful Bookings = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[successful_bookings]) 

Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Total cancelled bookings],[Total Bookings]) 

No Show rate % = DIVIDE([Total no show bookings],[Total Bookings]) 

Total cancelled bookings = CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Cancelled") 

Total Checked Out = CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Checked Out") 

-- ‚≠ê Customer Insights
Average Rating = AVERAGE(fact_bookings[ratings_given])
